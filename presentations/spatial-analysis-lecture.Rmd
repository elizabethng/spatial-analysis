# Biref overview of spatial analysis

## Why spatial data?
* Interesting spatial questions
* Earth is round-ish/spherioid
* Maps and screens are flat, so we only see projected data
* Projected distances, areas, shapes, and directions are distorted

## Reference systems
* [Geodesic/geographic coordinates](https://edzer.github.io/rstudio_conf/#6) need
  - Order (lat/long vs long/lat)
  - Units (rad, arc_degree)
  - Datum (aka reference ellipsoid)
    <!-- * how are we describing the shape of the Earth? -->
    <!-- * "best" approximation depends on region and scale -->
    <!--   - what origin is used? -->
    <!--   - tectonic plates move over time -->
    <!--   - e.g., WGS84, is an approximate model of Earth at sea level updated in 2004 -->
* [Cartesian/projected coordinates](https://www.axismaps.com/guide/general/map-projections/) need
  - Units (km, m)
  - Relationship to a datum/geodesic coordinates
  - How to display 3D object in 2D
  - Accurately display one of: area (Mercator), form (Azimuthal Equidistant), distance (Equirectangular)
  <!-- - choice depends on what you're conveying, shape of the region -->
  <!-- - e.g., use Tranverse Mercator for mapping long N-S region like Chile -->
* Two separate issues: how do we model Earth (datum) and how do we display it on a flat surface (projection)


<!-- ## Models of a round-ish Earth -->
<!-- * There are different models of the Earth -->
<!-- * Meaning of coordinates (lon/lat) depend on the geodetic datum -->
<!-- * "_Geodetic datum_ is a coordinate reference system and a set of reference points used to locate places on Earth"[Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodetic_datum) -->
<!-- * "a datum is unlikely important when mapping continents, but it is when when drones try to deliver pizza" -[Edzer Pebesma]https://edzer.github.io/rstudio_conf/#6) -->
<!-- * Depend on the scale (big or small matter more? where you are matters?) -->
<!-- * On one hand, small areas are more easily modeled as a flat surface -->
<!-- * But get your model wrong from continent to drone delivery matters -->
<!-- * Model is described in a coordinate reference system (CRS) -->
<!-- * Two types -->
<!--   - geographic CRS (lon/lat) gives distance from the origin in degrees -->
<!--   - projected CRS (easting/northing) gives distance from the origin in km -->
<!-- - [ ] Datum?? -->

## Representation of spatial data
- *Vector data model* uses points, lines, and polygons
- *Raster data model* divides surface into cells of constant size
- Non spatial attribute data
  - How many counts at a point?
  - Length of a transect
  - Land-cover type of a polygon

## Things we want from spatial software
> 1. Read/write spatial data
> 2. Represent geographic and attribute data
> 3. Transform between different models of Earth
> 4. Geographic operations
> 5. Make maps


# Brief background on spatial analysis in R

## R packages for spatial analysis
- [Many tools for spatial analysis in R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Spatial.html)
- `rgdal` released in 2003--import from more geographic data formats
- `sp` released in 2005--creates spatial objects with classes and generic methods for points, lines, polygons, grids, and attribute data (but still lacked ability to do geometric operations)
- `raster` released in 2010--support for raster operations and more

## R packages linking to GIS software
- `GRASS`, `spgrass6`, and `rgrass7`
- `RSAGA`, `RPyGeo`, and `RQGIS`

## Visualization
- `ggplot2`
- `ggmap`
- `rasterVis`
- `tmap`
- `leaflet`
- `mapview`

## My choice: `sf`
* Developed in 2016 with support from [R consortium](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf/blob/master/PROPOSAL.md)
* Based on [simple features ISO standards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Features) that are not R specific
* Replaces `sp`, `rdgal` for read/write, and `rgeos` for geometric operations
* Integrates well with `tidyverse`

## Resources
* [Simple Features package](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/index.html)
  - Vignettes, blogs, presentations
  - [Cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/sf.pdf)
  - [issue tracker](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf/issues/)
* [r-spatial](https://www.r-spatial.org/about/) Edzer Pebesma's blog
* [Spatial Data Science](https://keen-swartz-3146c4.netlify.com/)
* [Geocomputation with R](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/)
  - excellent in-depth treatment
  - includes theory, examples, and covers rasters




# `sf` Package

## Simple features
* _feature_ "abstraction of real world phenomena"
* _simple feature_ "feature with all geometric attributes described by piecewise straight lines or planar interpolation between sets of points"
* Represents geometry using *points*, *lines*, *polygons*, or collections of those features
* ISO standard supported by lots of software

## Basic structure
* `sf` objects are extended `data.frame`s or `tibble`s
  - attribute data stored as `tibble`
  - geometry stored as a list column
  - can have multiple types of geometry in one object
* class is `sfc` with bounding box `bbox` and `CRS` attributes

---

```{r}
fileloc <- system.file("shape/nc.shp", package = "sf")
nc <- read_sf(fileloc) %>%
  select(AREA, NAME)
print(nc)

# Highlight parts
# 1. list column (aka sfc)
# 2. feature geometry (sfg)
# 3. feature (row)
```

## `sf` and `tidyverse`
* `sf` functions begin with `st_`
* Methods for `summary`, `plot`
* `sf` methods for `filter`, `arrange`, `distinct`, `group_by`, `ungroup`, `mutate`


---
```{r echo = TRUE}
st_geometry(nc) %>% plot
```

---
```{r echo = TRUE}
# Default methods for objects
plot(nc)
```

---
```{r echo = TRUE}
filter(nc, AREA > 0.2)
```


# Reading and Writing Data

## Reading shapefiles
```{r echo = TRUE}
fileloc <- system.file("shape/nc.shp", package = "sf")
nc <- read_sf(fileloc)
```

We can see that projection information is stored with the shapefile
```{r echo = TRUE}
st_crs(nc)
```

* used to convert coordinates (do projections) and do datum transformations
* Proj.4 string or ESPG code contains this info
* [Web](https://spatialreference.org/) [repositories](https://georepository.com/home.html) for ESPG and Proj.4 information

---
```{r echo = TRUE}
st_crs("+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84") # Proj.4 string"
st_crs(3857)                         # ESPG code
st_crs(3857)$units                   # check units
st_crs(NA)                           # unknown (assumed planar/Cartesian)
```

---
* `st_transform` transforms or converts coordinates to [new reference system](https://edzer.github.io/UseR2017/)
```{r echo = TRUE}
(a1 <- st_area(nc[1,])) # area, using geosphere::areaPolygon
(a2 <- st_area(st_transform(nc[1, ], 32119))) # NC state plane, m
(a3 <- st_area(st_transform(nc[1,], 2264)))   # NC state plane, US foot
```

---
```{r echo = TRUE}
units::set_units(a1, km^2)
units::set_units(a2, km^2)
units::set_units(a3, km^2)
```


## Other data sources
> * Convert from other `Spatial*` objects using `st_as_sf`
> * Convert long/lat data
> * Packages such as `naturalearth`

## Convert long/lat data
```{r warning = FALSE}
# Scrape some lat/lon data (see example at https://ryanpeek.github.io/2017-08-03-converting-XY-data-with-sf-package/)
url <- "http://www.hotspringsdirectory.com/usa/ca/gps-usa-ca.html"
df <- htmltab(url, which = 1, header = 1,
              colNames = c("STATE","LAT","LONG","SpringName","Temp_F", "Temp_C", "AREA", "USGS_quad"))
hotsprings_df <- df %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  mutate(LAT = as.numeric(LAT),
         LONG = as.numeric(LONG),
         Temp_F = as.numeric(Temp_F),
         Temp_C = as.numeric(Temp_C),
         LONG = -LONG) %>%
  na.omit()
```

```{r, echo = TRUE}
head(hotsprings_df)
```

## Convert long/lat data
Assume that these data are WGS84 (`crs = 4326`)
```{r, echo = TRUE}
hotsprings <- st_as_sf(hotsprings_df,
                       coords = c("LONG", "LAT"),
                       crs = 4326)
head(hotsprings)
```


## Data from packages
```{r, echo = TRUE}
world <- ne_countries(scale = "medium", returnclass = "sf")
st_geometry(world) %>% plot()
```

## Writing data
* shapefiles
* database connections
* use `st_write`

## Exercises
1. Load the Lake Tahoe shapefile (`data\h8_tahoe`). What is the `crs`? Plot the geometry.
2. Upload `boat-launch-sites.csv` and plot the geometry. Save it as a shapefile. 

## Exercise 1
```{r echo = TRUE}
tahoe <- read_sf(here("data", "h8_tahoe"))
st_crs(tahoe)
st_geometry(tahoe) %>% plot()
```

## Exercise 2
```{r echo = TRUE}
boats <- read.csv(here("data", "boat-launch-sites.csv"))
boats_spatial <- st_as_sf(boats,
                       coords = c("lon", "lat"),
                       crs = 4326)
st_geometry(boats_spatial) %>% plot
```

## Exercise 2
```{r echo = TRUE}
dir.create(here("data", "boat-launch-sites"))
st_write(boats_spatial, here("data", "boat-launch-sites", "boat-launch-sites.shp", overwrite = TRUE))
```



# Geometric operations

## Types of geometric operations
Single

* logical predicates: (e.g., `is_valid`, `is_simple`)
* quantities: (`length`, `area`)
* dimensions: 0 = points, 1 = linear, 2 = surface
* derived geometries: `buffer`, `centroid`, `convex_hull` etc.

Pairs or sets
* predicates: `intersects`, `within`, `contains` etc.
* quantities: `distance`
* new geometries: `intersection`, `difference`, `union` etc.

CHECK: what does predicate mean?

## Give some examples...

## Exercises
1. How many points are within 10 km of this river?
2. Create a 1 km x 1 km sampling grid and randomly select 10 survey locations.


# Making maps with `sf` and `ggplot2`

## Basics
* interfaces with `ggplot2` using `geom_sf`
